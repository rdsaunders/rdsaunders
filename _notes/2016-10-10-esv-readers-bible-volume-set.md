title: ESV Readers Bible, Six Volume Set
date: 2016-10-10
excerpt: This new six volume set has been carefully crafted to make reading the Bible even more enjoyable, Crossway have done a beautiful job . I love the attention to detail, choice of typeface, line length and paper stock. I'd love to see a set on my book case as well as opened on my desk.

The two finishes look great, I especially like the walnut encasing which wraps the cowhide bindings of the volumes. Take a look at [readersbible.org](http://www.readersbible.org) for an indepth look.
