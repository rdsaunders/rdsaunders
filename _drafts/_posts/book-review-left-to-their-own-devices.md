Do you have children in junior school or above, or a child of any age for that matter, then get a copy of this book.

How many of us right now are staring at our bright screens. What we do is mimicked by our children and as parents we need to understand the pressures, the addictive nature and what can come through these screens we hand over to our children.

Today’s digital world changes rapidly and can act as a modern day drug that can be accessed any time, any where.

This book takes a sensitive but practical approach on helping families understand the benefits and dangers of the digital world, and the devices that give our children access to it. It covers topics such as parenting styles, unity in approach, social media, screen time, sexting, pornography, grooming and online bullying, addiction and discernment.

If you’re looking for an easy to read on a topic that is only going to become broader and more complex as our digital lifestyles change and adapt. Then I highly recommended this book for your reading list!
