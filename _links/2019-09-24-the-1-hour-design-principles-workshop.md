title: The 1-hour design principles workshop
link: https://matthewstrom.com/writing/design-principles-workshop.html
excerpt: Design principles are a valuable tool for any team that works together towards
  a shared outcome. Written well, design principles can create alignment, speed up
  decision-making, and increase the quality of the team’s output.  Lately, I’ve worked
  with two of my teams to write design principles.
