title: The problem with tooltips and what to do instead
link: https://adamsilver.io/articles/the-problem-with-tooltips-and-what-to-do-instead/
excerpt: Tooltips are messages that appear when the user hovers over part of an interface,
  usually an icon, to explain how certain things work or what they mean. They then
  disappear when the user hovers off the element. Adam explains some of the pitfalls
  with tooltips and offers some alternative advice.
